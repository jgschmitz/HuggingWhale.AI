🧬 HuggingWhale.AI Origin Story
<br>
Born from Chaos. Forged by Jeffs.
It started as a joke. Two engineers — Jeff Schmitz and Jeff Cheak — were tired of brittle pipelines, half-baked wrappers, and LLM demos that needed 14 .env files to function.

So they built HuggingWhale.AI:

A tongue-in-cheek, drop-anything-and-we'll-RAG-it playground powered by sarcasm, real embeddings, and whales with strong opinions.
They called themselves the Council of Jeffs, and with a few narwhal facts and a Gradio UI, accidentally created a platform that:

Ran faster than most “serious” LLM stacks

Had better UX than your enterprise AI tool

Got featured on a fake WIRED cover that felt a little too real

And now?

HuggingWhale is shipping real vector infra while roasting your PDFs.
