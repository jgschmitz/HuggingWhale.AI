Drop your PDF / audio / messy doc → Get structured insights like it’s nothing. Because you could build this yourself... but like, why?

🤖 What is this?
huggingwhale.ai is your all-in-one, zero-config, emoji-laden, AI wrapper playground that helps you pretend you're doing real machine learning.

We took all the hard stuff (RAG, chunking, embeddings, multi-agent orchestration)
and wrapped it in a giant whale hug. So now, you too can act like an AI savant with minimal effort. 🧠💅

This is not just another wrapper. This is another wrapper... but with vibes.

🚀 Features
🧠 Built-in RAG, Chunking, Embeddings
Plug in anything: PDFs, .mp3s, transcripts from your ex’s voicemail — we’ll extract structured insights like a clairvoyant librarian.

🧩 Multi-Agent Playground
Drag. Drop. React with 😮 when an agent misbehaves.
Yes, agents can talk to each other. Yes, they gossip.

🌈 No Config Nightmares
You won’t need YAML therapy after this.

☁️ Deploy Anywhere
Works out of the box with:

 HuggingFace 🤗

 Replicate 🌀

 Your sketchy home GPU 🖥️ in a shoebox

🔐 Hug-First Privacy
No snooping. No telemetry. No weird terms of service.
Just warm, consensual AI processing.
